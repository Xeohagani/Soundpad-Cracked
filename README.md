# Soundpad-Cracked

High-quality reproduction of sounds in voice chats (digital conversion is used).

You're probably familiar with the Soundboard app, which lets you combine different sounds, like those from Duke Nukem. Soundpad will allow you to play such sounds so that other users in the chat can hear them.

# Functions
Playing sound in voice chats
Works in any voice applications (for example, Teamspeak, Mumble, Skype, Discord), as well as in games such as Dota2, CS:GO and PUBG.

# Hotkeys
For sound instruments, you can set the hot wire while playing.

# Recording and editing audio
Soundpad Lets you record what you hearâ€”the sounds played back on your PC. And with the help of the built-in editor, the above can be quickly mounted.

# Normalization of the review
Are some audio sounds quiet and others too loud? The normalization feature equalizes eye levels so that they pay attention to your voices.

# advanced setting
Soundpad extends the functionality of the default recording device - most often a microphone - without the need to install additional hardware.
After installing the application and restarting the system, you will be able to play audio files in the microphone channel.

# Supported File Types
The following file types are supported: aac, flac, m4a, mp3, ogg, wav, wma.
